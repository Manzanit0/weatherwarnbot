### Running the migrations

Regarding the migrations, I leverage flyway and running them manually before
deploying due to its simplicity, but since they are raw SQL, you can use a dozen
other different tools. Regarding flyway, you can see how it's leveraged both in
the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file and in the `rw-migrate` make
target.
